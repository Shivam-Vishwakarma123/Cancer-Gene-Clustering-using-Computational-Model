# Cancer-Gene-Clustering-using-Computational-Model
The aim of gene expression clustering is to identify and extract the cohorts of genes that are behaving coordinately from the complete set of genes that are detected within a particular context. 


Cancer-gene clustering using computational models involves grouping genes that are related to cancer based on similarities in gene expression profiles or other genetic features. The clustering process is done using computational algorithms, which can help to identify relationships between genes that may be involved in the development or progression of cancer. Here are the basic steps involved in cancer-gene clustering using computational models:

Data Collection: The first step is to collect the relevant gene expression data from various sources. Gene expression data may include information on mRNA levels, miRNA levels, DNA copy number variations, epigenetic modifications, and other relevant genetic features.

Preprocessing: Once the data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed to remove any noise or artifacts that may affect the clustering results. This involves data normalization, transformation, and filtering.

Feature Selection: The next step is to select the most relevant features or genes that are associated with cancer. This involves identifying genes that are differentially expressed between cancer and normal samples, or genes that have a known association with cancer.

Clustering: Once the relevant features or genes are selected, the next step is to cluster them based on their similarities. There are various clustering algorithms that can be used for this purpose, such as hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering, and fuzzy clustering.

Validation: The clustering results need to be validated to ensure their accuracy and relevance. This involves evaluating the quality of the clustering results, assessing the biological significance of the clusters, and comparing the results with known cancer-related pathways or biological functions.

Interpretation: Finally, the clustering results need to be interpreted to gain insights into the underlying biological mechanisms of cancer. This involves identifying the most important genes or pathways that are associated with cancer, and analyzing the functional relationships between them.

Overall, cancer-gene clustering using computational models is a powerful tool for identifying genes and pathways that are associated with cancer and can provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of cancer.
